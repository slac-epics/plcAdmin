This is the plcAdmin package, which provides a set of PLC diagnostics and
statistics to EPICS.  This package has three parts: a ladder logic routine to 
be loaded in a PLC, an EPICS database to read the information from the PLC, 
and an EDM screen to show the PLC information.  Instructions for setting up 
and using plcAdmin are located in the doc subdirectory.
