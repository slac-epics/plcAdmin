Instructions for Allen-Bradley ControlLogix PLC:

1. Changing the desired program number:
	The expected PLC program version number is stored on the IOC.  This
	must be updated if a new program (with a new version number) is loaded
	on the PLC.  To update the expected PLC program version number, modify the
	substitutions file in your <appname>App/Db directory.  In this substitutions
	file, three macros define the expected version number:
	(Note: The format of the PLC logic version number is MAJ.MIN.REV)

	VERMAJ - the first part of the PLC logic version number
	VERMIN - the second part of the PLC logic version number
	VERREV - the third part of the PLC logic version number

	Modify these three macros to match the expected PLC logic version
	number.
