This file provides directions for adding the plcAdmin PLC ladder logic 
to your PLC program.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Allen-Bradley ControlLogix PLC:
	
1. Open your PLC program in RSLogix 5000.

2. In a second RSLogix 5000 window, open the file plcAdminControlLogix.l5k.
A prompt will ask you to save the imported project.  Select a filename
(plcAdminControlLogix is fine) and click Import.

3. In the left sidebar of the plcAdminControlLogix RSLogix window, expand the Data
Types folder, then the User-Defined folder.  Right-click on FAULTRECORD and
select Copy.

4. In the left sidebar of your PLC's RSLogix window, expand the Data Types
folder.  Right-click on User-Defined and select Paste.  The FAULTRECORD data
type should appear in your PLC's user-defined data type list.

5. Copy and paste all the controller tags from plcAdminControlLogix into
your project's controller tag list.

6. In the left sidebar of the plcAdmin RSLogix window, expand the Controller
folder, then the Power-Up Handler folder.  Right-click the Powerup_Program
folder and select copy.  In your project's RSLogix window, paste the
Powerup_Program into the Power-Up Handler folder.

7. In the plcAdmin RSLogix window, right click on plcAdminProgram and select
copy.  In your project's RSLogix window, right-click on MainTask and select
Paste.
If you wish, you can now close RSLogix window containing the
plcAdminControlLogix template.  All the remaining steps are done inside your
PLC project.

8. In the controller tag editor, change the name of the array
PLCADMIN_PLC_location_unit.  For example, if your PLC is the LCLS injector
magnet PLC, with EPICS name PLC:IN20:MG01 and network nodename plc-in20-mg01,
your array should be called PLCADMIN_PLC_IN20_MG01. 

9. In your project's plcAdmin ladder, make the following changes:
Rungs 11 through 20 retrieve scan times of your main task, the plcAdmin
program, and up to three other programs.
In rungs 11 and 12, change the Instance Name in the GSV instruction
so that it matches the name of your main task. 
Rungs 13 and 14 are reserved for the plcAdminProgram.  Do not change these
tags. 
In rungs 15-16, 17-18, and 19-20, change the Instance Name in the GSV
instruction so that it matches the name of up to three programs in your PLC.
 
10. Enter a version number for your PLC's ladder logic program and a document
number for your PLC's ladder logic in the appropriate plcAdmin tags:

a. The version of your PLC program has three parts.  It is of
the form x.y.z, where x is the major version number, y is the minor version
number, and z is the revision number.  This version number is stored 
in the following program tags (in program plcAdmin):
	PLCADMIN_VERSIONMAJOR
	PLCADMIN_VERSIONMINOR
	PLCADMIN_VERSIONREV
Under plcAdminProgram, double-click Program Tags.  At the bottom of the
program tag window, click the "Monitor Tags" tab.  Scroll down the list of
tags until you find the group of three PLCADMIN_VERSION tags.  Assign the
appropriate values to these tags.

b. A graphical version of your ladder logic should be added to the SLAC
document control system.  The document will be assigned a SLAC document
number of the form aa-bbb-ccc-dd-Ree, where aa is the prefix, bb is the Series,
cc is the Base, dd is the Suffix, and ee is the Revision. 

This document number is stored in the following PLC tags:
	PLCADMIN_DOCPREFIX *** see note below for the Prefix field
	PLCADMIN_DOCSERIES
	PLCADMIN_DOCBASE
	PLCADMIN_DOCSUFFIX
	PLCADMIN_DOCREV
Open the Program Tag window for the plcAdminProgram, and click Monitor Tags
in the bottom of the window.  Find the PLCADMIN_DOC tags and enter the
appropriate values.

*** The prefix field is a two letter abbreviation.  Please enter the number
corresponding to your document's prefix.  The available prefixes and their
corresponding numbers are:

 0 (no document number entered)
 1 SD
 2 BD
 3 DL
 4 EI
 5 FC
 6 FS
 7 IM
 8 LD
 9 OM
10 QT
11 WD


Now the initial setup of the plcAdmin PLC logic is complete.  When you release
new versions of your PLC program, follow the instructions in
plc-maintenance-instructions.txt.
