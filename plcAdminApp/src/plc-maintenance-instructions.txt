This file contains instructions for using the plcAdmin ladder logic routine in
a PLC.

Instructions for Allen-Bradley ControlLogix PLC:

1. Changing the PLC program version number

Every new release of a PLC program has a version number with form x.y.z where
x is the major version, y is the minor version, and z is the revision.  

This version number is stored in the following program tags (in program plcAdmin):
        PLCADMIN_VERSIONMAJOR
        PLCADMIN_VERSIONMINOR
        PLCADMIN_VERSIONREV
When releasing a new version of your PLC logic, make sure to update these
three tags with the version number of the new PLC logic.

2. Changing the document number

A graphical version of your ladder logic should be added to the SLAC
document control system.  The document will be assigned a SLAC document
number of the form aa-bbb-ccc-dd-Ree, where aa is the prefix, bb is the
Series,
cc is the Base, dd is the Suffix, and ee is the Revision.

This document number is stored in the following PLC tags:
        PLCADMIN_DOCPREFIX *** see note below for the Prefix field
        PLCADMIN_DOCSERIES
        PLCADMIN_DOCBASE
        PLCADMIN_DOCSUFFIX
        PLCADMIN_DOCREV

When releasing a new version of your PLC logic, make sure to update these five
tags with the correct document number for your PLC logic.

Assign the appropriate values to these tags in the program tag editor.
*** The prefix field is a two letter abbreviation.  Please enter the number
corresponding to your document's prefix.  The available prefixes and their
corresponding numbers are:
